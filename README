Repository for the 3D face reconstrution method named 3DI, introduced in ECCV'20 in the paper titled "Inequality-Constrained and Robust 3D Face Model Fitting".

A new and CUDA-based version of the code is available here: http://www.sariyanidi.com/media/3DI_packageNone.zip

We will start maintaining the CUDA code on this github, but in the meanwhile you can use the link above.
